        <h3>"Send Me An Angel"</h3>
        <p>The wise man said just walk this way<br />
           To the <strong>dawn of the light</strong><br />
           The wind will blow into your face<br />
           As the years pass you by</p>
        <p>Hear this voice from deep inside<br />
           It's the call of your <span>heart</span><br />
           Close your eyes and you will find<br />
           The passage out of the dark</p>
        <p><em>Here I am</em><br />
           Will you send me an angel?<br />
           Here I am<br />
           In the land of the morning star</p>
        <p>The wise man said just find your place<br />
           In the eye of the storm<br />
           Seek the roses along the way<br />
           Just beware of the thorns</p>
        <p>Here I am<br />
           Will you send me an angel?<br />
           Here I am<br />
           In the land of the morning star</p>
        <p>The wise man said just raise your hand<br />
           And reach out for the spell<br />
           Find the door to the promised land<br />
           Just believe in yourself</p>
        <p>Hear this voice from deep inside<br />
           It's the call of your heart<br />
           Close your eyes and you will find<br />
           The way out of the dark</p>
        <p>[4x]<br />
           Here I am<br />
           Will you send me an angel?<br />
           Here I am<br />
           In the land of the morning star</p>
